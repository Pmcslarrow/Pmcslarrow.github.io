    The article, "Employers steal billions from workersâ€™ paychecks each year", does a great job at quickly addressing an issue at hand and then pairing
    it up with the data to support the argument. While the data that they use to support the argument is interesting to look at, I question whether it is
    ethical in the way that they received it. Most major data sources go through a process of verifying the authenticity, integrity, and accuracy of the data.
    While I do believe the argument is true, that employers most likely do steal billions from workers, I am unsure how accurate it is to send surveys to
    collect the data. Surveys are the least viable way to collect this sort of data because those that answer it are most likely more biased to answer 
    more radical answers. Besides the preperation of the data being a little suspect, I will say that I think it is an ethically good article to read,
    because lots of people just assume that they may be getting the paycheck that they deserve, whereas they could be losing money in the process without even
    knowing. We are actually unable to conclude whether the data is being used ethically, it all depends on ones moral compass as well as how they manipulate
    or demonstrate the data themselves. Today, data scientists have a duty to society to ensure that the data that is being used is the most accurate and authentic
    and that their data has nonrepudiation involved to understand where they collected the data.
