            The article <i>'How AI Is Improving Accessibility'</i> by Malini Boorgu explains to the reader how recent
            discoveries with AI and natural language processing are helping benefit the neurodivergent community. Neurodivergence
            is defined as "differing in mental or neurological function from what is considered typical or normal". More often than not,
            people who are considered neurodivergent are put at a disadvantage when entering the workforce. Until recently, neurodivergent people
            were expected to perform the same tasks in the same amount of time as neurotypical people -- which is clearly disadvantageous towards
            them. Boorgu argues that the upbringing of apps with AI accessibility, like InnerVoice, are the answer for how to help
            neurodivergent people. Boorgu creates a fine argument that the future should be moving towards these AI accessiblity apps
            for the benefit of neurodivergent people, although, the problem occurs when you realize that apps exist, like ChatGPT,
            for neurotypical people to use at their own benefit as well. <b>While AI accessibility can be greatly beneficial for those that
            are in need of it, we need to be cautious that we aren't in heavy reliance on their abilities, because at the end of the day,
            as far as things like automatic summarization have come, they cannot be purely reliable for the workforce.</b>
