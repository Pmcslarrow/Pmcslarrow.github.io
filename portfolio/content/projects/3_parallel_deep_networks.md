## Overview

This is a non-technical, passion-driven presentation that explores the foundations of distributed deep learning. I explain key concepts such as **data parallelism** and **model parallelism**, and then dive into a research paper that caught my attention: **ZeRO (Zero Redundancy Optimizer)**. 

The presentation is conceptual in nature—no code was used—focusing instead on the ideas and motivations behind distributed approaches to training deep learning models.
