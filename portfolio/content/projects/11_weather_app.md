## Overview

This was my very first personal project I had to complete in a computer science class. I was tasked to design any website that was to utilize HTML/CSS/JS and that functions. I decided, at the time, that it was most appropriate to learn how to use an API and integrate it into an application. While it is nothing outstanding, this project will forever stay close at heart. 

## Features

- Displays the city name that a user is searching for
- Displays the temperature in either (c/f). 
- Contains a bar on the left side of the screen that displays the next or previous 4 days of weather.
