---

Hello! 👋

I'm currently a student at **Northwestern University** with a strong passion for technology—especially in the areas of **Software Engineering**, **Machine Learning/Deep Learning**, and **Parallel Computing**. I'm particularly interested in how we can harness data to drive meaningful predictions and insights 📊. Beyond the models themselves, I’m also deeply curious about **performance**—whether it's optimizing training times, improving memory efficiency, or accelerating computation through parallelism ⚡️.

Outside of my studies, I’ve been a passionate **sports fan** my entire life 🏀. I played basketball at **Willamette University** and remain a dedicated **Utah Jazz** supporter!

I love to **golf** whenever I get the chance ⛳, and I find a lot of peace in **reading** during my free time 📚. Coding started as a personal hobby for me, but I’ve grown to enjoy it so much that I’ve decided to pursue it as a **career** 💻.

If you’d like to get to know me better—or just want to chat about **sports**, **tech**, or anything else I’ve mentioned—please don’t hesitate to reach out! 🙌
