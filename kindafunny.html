    The Youtube video, We Need To Fix Black Hair in Video Games, talks about a huge issue that should be addressed more often in the Game Development community.
    Suggested from the title of the video, details for black hair in video games tend to be minute compared to those of other cultures. While it is mentioned that
    a huge portion of the game development market is based in Asian cultures, a lack knowledge exists on how to properly design games that are more inclusive. While
    this is true for some of the games in different cultures that specialize in different aspects of life and imagination (like the freaky fly creature in the video),
    this still creates a dilemma for game development company's that exist in the United States. One who begins to think about the issues of black hair in video games
    will question why certain games that are being created in the industry today on next generation consoles (that cannot make the excuse about not having enough
    memory and/ or RAM to handle more detailed hairstyles) are still getting away with not making more detailed hairstyles based on the more diverse cultures other than
    white hairstyles. A character artist, Del Walker, mentioned that some of the older games may actually have an excuse for why the hairstyles were so inaccurate,
    but also raised the point that next-gen character design has no limits, and that limits are only created through the lack of knowledge about a certain culture
    and/ or effort into the detail. For those that are interested in this sort of issue can be glad to know that by the end of the video, game developers
    talked about how the customization side of games is pushing for a more diverse and inclusive environment for all players.
