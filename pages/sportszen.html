      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>SportZen is a React and Firebase application designed to enhance communication between the coaching staff and players of Willamette Men's Basketball. The core concept behind SportZen is to empower players to submit daily survey data, providing insights into their mental, physical, and sleep quality, as well as self-assessments of their performance during practice or games. I later decided that it wasn't worth continuing the concept, but the skills and ideas from this project lead to the motivation of HoopEasy. </p>
