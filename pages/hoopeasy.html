      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>
        Collaborated with Willamette MBA candidates to develop HoopEasy, a full-stack application designed to simplify finding and joining pickup basketball games in the USA. The platform allowed users to search for nearby games using geocoding, create their own games, and track their performance with an integrated ELO rating system. The goal was to enhance the pickup basketball experience by making it more accessible, engaging, and competitive. 
        If interested in learning more, please read the README file on 
        the Github repo. A lot went into this project and I really enjoyed the process.
