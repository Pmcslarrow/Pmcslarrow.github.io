                    I am a student at Willamette University extremely
                    curious to learn more about web development
                    (front and backend).
                    In addition to my love for technology,
                    I am also interested in basketball, physics books,
                    and video games.

                    My syntax knowledge is best with Python because it was the first
                    language that I ever learned. I have become more skilled and proficient
                    in JavaScript and React through the projects that I have worked on.
                    I say that I am "Elementary" at best with Node.js and Express.js because I think
                    that these backend technologies are dense and I am mostly comfortable with basic things
                    like creating an API.

                    My most recent project that helped me learn about the frontend and backend well.
                       The website allows non-members to see the home page and the calendar events. The dashboard
                       is a simple backend CRUD system that allows the members of the Sigma Chi Chapter with the ability
                       to edit frontend calendar events and users allowed in the system through MongoDB.

                        The Chatroom App was my first ever React project. 
                        The main design of the website is derived 
                        from Internet Relay Chat (IRC) design. First though,
                        the user must enter their name and room they want to join,
                        which then triggers Socket.io to move the user to a room where
                        they can communicate with their friends!
                        <br>
                        I chose not to deploy this, simply because I didn't want to deal with
                        the network layer security issues in a language that I was new to.

                       The visualization part was learned through TechWithTim, although, the purpose of the project was not purely about the visualization whereas
                       it was more focused on learning how the algorithm thinks.

                    <p>My final project for CS-270 Web Development. This project is one of my favorites
                        that I have ever developed because it felt like the first time that I was able
                        to step out of simple syntax learning within a language
                        and actually apply it to something fun. I used the openweathermap API
                        to gather information about a given city that is entered by the user.
                        The user is then able to learn about the previous and next four days
                        of weather (in F or C).

                    <p>This was a short yet necessary projects that taught me how to interact between the frontend and backend.
                       I used PostgreSQL as the database system (locally) to create the project, although, when I later implemented the same User Management
                       system into my Delta Zeta Project, I adjusted everything that was postgreSQL onto MongoDB Atlas.
