    The article "When Are We Gonna Have a Serious Conversation About How Unserious (and Problematic) SIGCSE Is?" by Dr. Nicki Washington feels more like a rant
    to the greater community rather than an article about the true underlying issues that SIGCSE presents. As a white male, I have no place in saying that I
    understand how she must feel as a "Black woman" in the CS community, although, I think that she could have better addressed the issue at hand. Some of the
    details mentioned by the reviewers on her paper were fair points to how she can better revise her message so that she could be more seriously considered.
    The majority of paragraphs and noting points in the article felt as though she couldn't exactly handle any of the revision points, and went to the forumns
    to discuss her frustrations. While I think many of the reasons that she was clearly upset with the issue seemed unprofessional through the use of words like
    -- "shit", "stinks", "asinine" -- I think that she overall raises a point that should have been more directly focussed on in her argument. She was extremely
    correct to be reacting the way that she was because of reviewer number 3 who (without reason) told her that she needed more "technical depth". As I read
    through, the article did nothing to convince me early on that her reasons were justified for feeling the way she did, until later on in the article when we met
    reviewer 3 and onwards. I think that if she lost some of the unprofessional wording as well as started the article discussing the true problem -- that the
    reviewers didn't take her consideration seriously because she (a black woman) was not "technically deep" -- would open up more room for the rest of the article
    to feel the way that she did. I too am extremely dissapointed after reading the article with how SIGCSE handled the reviewing situation as it is was evident
    that they didn't even review closely (having missed crucial detials such as "Hook" vs. "hook"). While I think that a lot of the article could actually be
    left out, Dr. Nicki Washington raises a great focus point / argument against SIGCSE -- who says that these reviewers are any more qualified than Dr. Nicki Washington
    and are more "technically [deep]" than her and that they are in any way being inclusive with those who they review daily. As mentioned previously, I am unable
    to speak to how she must actually feel as a black woman in the field of CS, although, I can say that she is completely valid in being upset with the unseriousness
    within the organization.
