              <li>While the community of Omelas focuses on being happy and content throughout their society, they only accomplish it by normalizing each other's individual suffering. </li>
              <li>The allegory of Omelas can be interpreted in such a way in our own society, that turns a blind eye from the issues in our community, to create individualistic happiness – at one’s suffering. </li>
              <li>The story about Omelas creates a connection between its world and our world – people in society benchmark their own happiness based on other peoples experiences.</li>
              <li>Similar to our own nation, Omelas’ seemingly perfect society justifies self immorality as a right of passage into being a part of the “happy” community. </li>
              <li>The society of Omelas attempts to normalize the fact that happiness in society cannot exist without suffering.</li>
              <li>The author uses self-reflection as a tool in Omelas to help us understand whether or not we can find relations from a fictional society with our own. </li>
              <li>Too often in our own society, individuals are able to relate closely to the story of Omelas, in the idea that we are willing to ignore the wrongdoings of others in order to gain self happiness as a society. </li>
              <li>Omelas create moral dilemmas for those reading. It seems as though the moral understanding from right or wrong is so clear to the individual in the moment, but through the breakage of the fourth wall, the author makes the reader question whether their own moral understanding of their own society is correct. </li>
              <li>Those who “walk ahead in darkness” are unable to normalize the wrong-doings of Omelas, yet despite not knowing if their future path is “happy” with regard to their previous society, they do understand, morally, that their society was wrong. </li>
              <li>The moral issue brought up in Omelas creates disproportion between whether or not it is morally correct to make an individual suffer for the happiness of an entire community. </li>
              <li>The author gives no help in the moral decision of Omelas – whether it is right to walk away from a society that is willing to hurt an individual for the happiness of others or vice versa. </li>
              <li>Omelas is an allegory with a purpose – to make the reader question whether they themselves have adjusted their moral compass to that of their society at the expense of other people’s pain. </li>
